🚀 Problem Statement

In many Indian cities and villages, public issues like:

potholes,

garbage overflow,

broken streetlights,

water leakage,

drainage blockage,

unsafe roads,

remain unresolved because:

citizens don’t know where/how to complain,

complaints are not tracked properly,

there is no transparency,

government departments don’t get organized reports,

💡 Solution

FixIndia provides a simple solution:

✅ Citizens upload a photo + location + issue type
✅ The issue is stored and sent to the responsible department
✅ The department updates the status (Pending → In Progress → Resolved)
✅ Once verified, the citizen receives a reward (money/points)
