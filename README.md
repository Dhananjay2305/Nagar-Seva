FixIndia is a civic-tech web platform where citizens can upload photos of society/public problems (potholes, garbage, streetlight issues, water leakage, etc.) and report them directly through a simple system. The government/authority can verify, solve the issue, and the citizen who reported it can receive a reward for contributing to society.
